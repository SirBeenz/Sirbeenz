## Hi there, I am Micheal KingðŸ‘‹
I am a communications and multimedia specialist based in Mississippi, currently serving at the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). With more than a decade of experience in design, branding, and public relations, Iâ€™ve led creative projects ranging from state agency brand guides to museum exhibits and interactive educational content. I also serve as Co-Chair of the Mississippi Litter Prevention Task Force and have been deeply involved with community organizations, including the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science Foundation and Autism Awareness of Southeast Missouri. Passionate about strategic communication and accessibility, I am preparing for Accreditation in Public Relations (APR) while continuing to shape innovative storytelling for public service, education, and environmental stewardship.
